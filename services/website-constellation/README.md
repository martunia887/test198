# The Constellation Website ✨🌟⭐️

Welcome to the new constellation website! Currently VERY under construction 🏗

## Using this website locally

```sh
cd services/website-constellation && yarn start
```

## Where are we deploying?

Currently we are deploying to https://constellation-test-site.netlify.com/ - this is done through a bitbucket pipelines step called `build-constellation-website`

This script can be automated at a later date once it has been merged to master.

Until then, it can be manually triggered in the bitbucket UI following the steps found [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/run-pipelines-manually-861242583.html)
