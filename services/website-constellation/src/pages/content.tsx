      <h1>Song: Some Nights</h1>
      <h2>Artist: Fun.</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck</p>
      <p>Some nights, I call it a draw</p>
      <p>Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle</p>
      <p>Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off</p>
      <br />
      <p>But I still wake up, I still see your ghost</p>
      <p>Oh Lord, I'm still not sure, what I stand for oh oh oh</p>
      <p>What do I stand for? Oh what do I stand for?</p>
      <p>Most nights, I don't know anymore</p>
      <p>Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa oh oh</p>
      <p>Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa oh oh</p>
      <br />
      <p>This is it, boys, this is war, what are we waiting for?</p>
      <p>Why don't we break the rules already?</p>
      <p>I was never one to believe the hype,</p>
      <p>
        Save that for the black and white I try twice as hard and I'm half as
        liked
      </p>
      <p>But here they come again to jack my style</p>
      <br />
      <p>That's alright, I found a martyr in my bed tonight</p>
      <p>
        Stops my bones from wondering just who I, who I, who I am, oh who am I,
        mm, mm
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Well some nights, I wish that this all would end</p>
      <p>'Cause I could use some friends for a change</p>
      <p>And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again</p>
      <p>Some nights, I always win, I always win</p>

      <p>But I still wake up, I still see your ghost</p>
      <p>Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh</p>
      <p>
        What do I stand for? Oh what do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know
        (come on)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>So this is it? I sold my soul for this?</p>
      <p>Washed my hands of that for this?</p>
      <p>I miss my mom and dad for this?</p>
      <p>No. When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are</p>
      <p>When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on</p>
      <p>Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh come on!</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Well that is it, yâ€™all, that is all, five minutes in and I'm bored again
      </p>
      <p>Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands</p>
      <p>
        This is not one for the folks at home, I'm sorry to leave, mom, I had to
        go
      </p>
      <p>Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?</p>
      <p>
        My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called "love"
      </p>
      <p>But when I look into my nephew's eyes,</p>
      <p>
        Man you wouldn't believe, the most amazing things, that can come from
      </p>
      <p>Some terrible nights, ah (oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh)</p>
      <br />
      <p>Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh</p>
      <p>Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and
        me
      </p>
      <p>I called you up, but we'd both agree</p>
      <p>It's for the best you didn't listen</p>
      <p>It's for the best we get our distance, oh</p>
      <p>It's for the best you didn't listen</p>
      <p>It's for the best we get our distance, oh</p>
