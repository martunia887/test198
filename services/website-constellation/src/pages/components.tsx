      <h1>Song: Four Seasons in One Day</h1>
      <h2>Artist: Crowded House</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Four seasons in one day</p>
      <p>Lying in the depths of your imagination</p>
      <p>Worlds above and worlds below</p>
      <p>The sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain</p>
      <br />
      <p>Even when you're feeling warm</p>
      <p>The temperature could drop away</p>
      <p>Like four seasons in one day</p>
      <br />
      <p>Smiling as the shit comes down</p>
      <p>You can tell a man from what he has to say</p>
      <p>Everything gets turned around</p>
      <p>And I will risk my neck again, again</p>
      <br />
      <p>You can take me where you will</p>
      <p>Up the creek and through the mill</p>
      <p>Like all the things you can't explain</p>
      <p>Four seasons in one day</p>
      <br />
      <p>Blood dries up</p>
      <p>Like rain, like rain</p>
      <p>Fills my cup</p>
      <p>Like four seasons in one day</p>
      <br />
      <p>It doesn't pay to make predictions</p>
      <p>Sleeping on an unmade bed</p>
      <p>Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain</p>
      <p>Only one step away</p>
      <p>Like four seasons in one day</p>

      <p>Blood dries up</p>
      <p>Like rain, like rain</p>
      <p>Fills my cup</p>
      <p>Like four seasons in one day</p>
    </div>
  </Layout>
