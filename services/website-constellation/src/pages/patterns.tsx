      <h1>Song: Let it Go</h1>
      <h2>Artist: Idina Menzel</h2>
      <br />
      <p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight</p>
      <p>Not a footprint to be seen</p>
      <p>A kingdom of isolation</p>
      <p>And it looks like I'm the queen</p>
      <br />
      <p>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside</p>
      <p>Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried</p>
      <p>Don't let them in, don't let them see</p>
      <p>Be the good girl you always have to be</p>
      <p>Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know</p>
      <p>Well, now they know</p>
      <br />
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>Can't hold it back anymore</p>
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>Turn away and slam the door</p>
      <p>I don't care what they're going to say</p>
      <p>Let the storm rage on</p>
      <p>The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
      <br />
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>Can't hold it back anymore</p>
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>Turn away and slam the door</p>
      <br />
      <p>It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small</p>
      <p>And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all</p>
      <p>It's time to see what I can do</p>
      <p>To test the limits and break through</p>
      <p>No right, no wrong, no rules for me</p>
      <p>I'm free</p>
      <br />
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>I am one with the wind and sky</p>
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>You'll never see me cry</p>
      <p>Here I stand and here I stay</p>
      <p>Let the storm rage on</p>
      <br />
      <p>My power flurries through the air into the ground</p>
      <p>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around</p>
      <p>And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast</p>
      <p>I'm never going back, the past is in the past</p>
      <br />
      <p>Let it go</p>
      <p>The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>And I'll rise like the break of dawn</p>
      <p>Let it go, let it go</p>
      <p>That perfect girl is gone</p>
      <p>Here I stand in the light of day</p>
      <p>Let the storm rage on</p>
