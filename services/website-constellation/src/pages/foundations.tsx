      <br />
      <p>All the pretty girls on a Saturday night</p>
      <br />
      <p>So I call, your name</p>
      <p>Cross my fingers, uncross the others</p>
      <p>Hesitate, oh I don't think straight</p>
      <p>With nothin' to prove</p>
      <br />
      <p>I don't wanna say I'm leavin'</p>
      <p>I'll stay until the weekend</p>
      <p>You can take all the things, the boxes and rings</p>
      <p>And get goin'</p>
      <p>'Cause I've been waitin' for</p>
      <br />
      <p>All the pretty girls on a Saturday night</p>
      <p>Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes</p>
      <p>Well you break and take all the words from my mouth</p>
      <p>I wish all the pretty girls were shakin' me down</p>
      <br />
      <p>So I call (I call) you out (out baby)</p>
      <p>Just to feel a little bit better about myself (he does)</p>
      <p>I do (you do), baby</p>
      <p>I do, I do, I do</p>
      <br />
      <p>Until their lips start to move</p>
      <p>And their friends talk music</p>
      <p>I'll say "I've never heard the tune."</p>
      <p>But I have, I just hate the band</p>
      <p>'Cause they remind me of you</p>
      <br />
      <p>Every single night ends up the same</p>
      <p>I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name</p>
      <p>(Over and over and over)</p>
      <p>I think it's striking me out</p>
      <br />
      <p>All the pretty girls on a Saturday night</p>
      <p>Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes</p>
      <p>Well you break and take all the words from my mouth</p>
      <p>I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down</p>
      <br />
      <p>But not you,</p>
      <p>You still wear boots and your hair is too long</p>
      <p>And then this one, doesn't wanna admit she's fallin' in love</p>
      <p>Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do</p>
      <p>When all the pretty girls can't measure to you ?</p>
      <br />
      <p>Ha !</p>
      <br />
      <p>I don't understand your reasons</p>
      <p>Please just stay over the weekend</p>
      <p>You can't take all those things</p>
      <p>They define you and me</p>
      <p>Everything we've become</p>
      <p>You're all that I need</p>
      <p>Please don't make me face my generation alone</p>
      <br />
      <p>All the pretty girls on a Saturday night</p>
      <p>Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes</p>
      <p>And you break and take all the words from my mouth</p>
      <p>I wish all the pretty girls were shakin' me down</p>
      <br />
      <p>But not you,</p>
      <p>I feel your faith is destroying the world</p>
      <p>And then this one, never really understood</p>
      <p>The 80's is over and done</p>
      <p>Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do,</p>
      <p>When all the pretty girls can't measure to you ?</p>
