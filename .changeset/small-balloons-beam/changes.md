ED-7492 add support to indent actions

This version adds support for indenting actions using the keyboard shortcuts Tab and Shift-Tab. You can also unindent items by backspacing them at the start, or deleting forwards within the task.

There is no new behaviour if the feature flag (`allowNestedTasks`) is turned off.
