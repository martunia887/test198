# Breadcrumbs 
Breadcrumbs are a navigation system used to show a user's location in a site or app.

## Examples 

### Basic breadcrumbs 

The standard form of breadcrumbs.

[Add example]

### Long breadcrumbs 

When a path contains more than five levels of items, the breadcrumb auto-collapses and uses ellipses to indicate more information. Only showing the first and last items are shown by default, however, the number of items shown before or after auto-collapse can be customized. This is useful when the user needs more information on the breadcrumb hierarchy to be aware of their location within the product. To reduce screen clutter, it's best practice to only use the first and last entity when collapsing. Users expand the breadcrumb by clicking on the ellipsis.

### Expanded breadcrumbs 

When expanded, breadcrumbs that exceed the page width will overflow to the next line.

### Truncation

Long item names will truncate and a tooltip containing the full item name will appear on hover. The length before truncation can be customized by pixel width.

### Icons 

Icons can be displayed before and after a breadcrumb item.

## Design 

### Anatomy diagram 

### Anatomy description
* Item name: The section or page within the product, usually a link. 
* Separator: Provides a visual distinction between individual entities using the same font as the rest of the breadcrumbs.
* Graphical elements: Some entities may have an icon or avatar before or after the entity name that is part of the corresponding page title.

### Usage 
* Breadcrumbs are an alternative way to help users orient themselves. They're a useful addition to, but shouldn’t replace, the main navigation on a page. 
* Use breadcrumbs for nested navigation, with each item acting as a link. They show the hierarchical progress from the highest item level to the lowest, one step at a time. This typically starts with the product landing page and goes to the current page or content.

### Best practices 
* Use breadcrumbs when the user is most likely to have landed on the page from an external source.
* Use for large websites and complex products that have hierarchically arranged pages, so that users who land on the page can quickly know where they are.
* In products, breadcrumbs can adapt to the state of navigation by being toggled on, off, or auto-collapsing.
* Make sure breadcrumbs don’t visually overwhelm the page.
* Place breadcrumbs at the top left corner of the screen, above the page title.
* In product, avoid using the topmost level of the hierarchy unless the navigation sidebar is collapsed.
