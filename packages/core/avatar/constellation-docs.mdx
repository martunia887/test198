# Avatr

An avatar is a visual representation of a user or entity. 

# Examples 

## Basic Avatar 

### Circular 

Use circular avatars to represent a group of people

## Avatar status

Note:  xsmall and xxlarge avatars don't support statuses.

## Usage

An avatar acts as a proxy for a user or entity (such as a project, repository, or space), in a product. 
They're often combined with status or presence indicators to give more context. 
Users generally upload their own image, otherwise, a default image is displayed. 

Use:

* circular avatars to quickly identify users

* square avatars to help identify large product entities like projects, spaces, groups, rooms, or repositories

* a presence indicator to indicate presence for a single user

* a status icon to indicate a user’s status in a product


# Code
