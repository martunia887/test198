# Banner 
A banner displays a prominent message at the top of the screen.

## Examples

#### Basic Banner

The standard form of a banner.

[Add example] 

#### Announcement [grey]
* Announcement banners are currently only used by Admins who want to make general announcements about the product

* An important heads up but not critical

* Can include a link to more info

[Add example]

#### Warning [Yellow]

* Use warning banners when you want the user to take a specific action or to warn them that something is about to go wrong

* Provide clear information about how they can fix things to keep moving

* These are a fixed height and don’t include overflow text

[Add example]

#### Error [red]
* Use error banners to inform users something critical has happened and requires immediate attention

* Explain what they should do to fix things or what we’ll be doing to fix things and what they can do in the meantime

* These are a fixed height and don’t include overflow text

These have a max height of 88 pixels and text can overflow to wrap. Any height larger allows users to scroll to see the rest of the content.

[Add example]

#### Overflow text 

Banner size can change based on the size of the browser. When this happens, the banner text should stay on a single line with an ellipsis.

## Design

### Anatomy Diagram 
### Anatomy Description

Icon: Only error and warning icons can be used.
Message: Give a short description of the severity of the issue, products affected, and any actions to remedy the situation.
Actions (optional): A link to a call to action or next steps. Any links to documentation should open in a new tab.

### Usage

* Use banners at the top of the screen to display critical messaging about the loss of data, functionality, or important site-wide information that affects the user's ability to use the product.

* Banners should appear one at a time, are not dismissible, and only disappear when no longer required.  
They animate into a screen by pushing the entire content below down.

### Best Practices 

* Use banners sparingly, particularly warning and error banners, as they are persistent and disrupt the user’s workflow. 

* Make sure that the key actionable information is visible at a glance.

* Make sure you use the correct banner type for your use case. If you’re unsure, check out our other message types.

* Always be clear, concise and, where possible, give follow up actions to allow the user to become more informed or resolve the issue.

### Content Guidelines 

* Use concise, scannable language that communicates the problem at a glance.

* Admit when the problem is ours by using the second person.

#### Do's and Don'ts:

* Tell the user what’s happening in non-technical terms and give them useful information about what they can do.
  * DO: We're having trouble retrieving some information. Please refresh the page.
  * DON'T: A database error has occurred. Please reload the page.

* Don’t make it seem like it’s the user’s fault when talking about an error. Instead, use the second or third person where possible 
  * DO: There’s a problem with creating issues at the moment. We're on it! Watch our status page for updates
  * DON'T: You can't create issues at the momen


### Accessbility
Make sure the words in the banner indicate the severity of the banner message instantly for users who can’t recognize certain colors.
