# Badge  
A badge is a visual indicator for numeric values such as tallies and scores.

## Examples 

### Default 
The standard form of badge. 

### Primary
To help draw attention to new or updated information. 

### Primary inverted
The inverse version of primary for use when high contrast against a darker background color is needed, for example in our global navigation. 

### Important
Calls attention to information that needs to stand out. For example, notifications in Confluence. 

### Added 
Use to show additions. For example, characters added to a line of code in Bitbucket.

### Removed
Use to show removals. For example, characters removed from a line of code in Bitbucket.  

[Probably the basic example is fine here?](#)

## Design 

### Usage 
Badges are usually placed before or after the label of the thing they're quantifying, such as the number of votes for an issue. They should only be used to represent a number, however, the following letters and special characters can be used to represent number values: +, -, K.

### Best Practices 
* Use badges in conjunction with a single item or label, to avoid ambiguity around which item is being quantified. 
* Include tooltips, where necessary, to enhance user understanding. For example, a badge is used in conjunction with an icon.

### Related Components (should this be a break out item?)

* For non-numeric status information, use a lozenge.
* To visually label UI objects, use a tag.
* Use lozenges for statuses.
* Call out tags and high-visibility attributes with labels.
