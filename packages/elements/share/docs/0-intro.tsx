  This package provides the view components allowing users to share a resource by
  sharing with User Picker, or by copying the share link.
  
  The goal is to provide a consistent share experience across products.
  
  ## Usage 
  
  Import the component in your React app as follows:
  
  ${code`import ShareDialogContainer from '@atlaskit/share;`}
  
  ${(
    <Example
      packageName="@atlaskit/share"
      Component={require('../examples/00-integration-with-configs').default}
      title="Example"
      source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/00-integration-with-configs')}
    />
  )}
 
  ${(
    <Props
      heading="Share Props"
      props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../src/components/ShareDialogContainer')}
    />
  )}
`;
